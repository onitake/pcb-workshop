PCB layouting workshop
======================

These are the example files for my KiCad printed circuit board
layouting workshop. There's not much here currently, except
for a schema and PCB layout for a µC controlled LED name plate.

The design is loosely based on [Larry Ogrodnek's nametag](http://analogmachines.com/p/nametag/build/),
with some enhancements. The LEDs are further apart (0.762mm)
and each letter block is powered by one small signal MOS-FET
to reduce the load on the microcontroller's output drivers.
